### **Aim:**  
To write prompts for the following prompt types and evaluate them using any one use case:  
1. Straightforward Prompts  
2. Tabular Format Prompting  
3. Preceding Question Prompting  
4. Missing Word Prompting  

---

### **Explanation:**  
**Use Case Chosen (from Unit 5):**General Knowledge and Science Education**  
General Knowledge and Science Education refers to the broad understanding and awareness of facts, concepts, and principles across various disciplines, including science, geography, technology, environment, and current affairs, aimed at developing informed, critical-thinking individuals.
We will apply all four prompt types to this use case.

### **Procedure & Example Prompts**

#### **1. Straightforward Prompts**  
Direct and simple queries to get specific answers.  

- **Prompt:** `Define photosynthesis in one sentence..`  
  **Response:**  
  Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.

- **Prompt:** `List three advantages of electric vehicles.`  
  **Response:**  
 1. Lower emissions – Electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gases.
 2. Lower operating costs – Electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, and EVs have fewer moving parts, leading to lower maintenance costs.
 3. Energy efficiency – EVs convert a higher percentage of energy from the grid to power at the wheels compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.

#### **2. Tabular Format Prompting**  
Information is presented in a structured table format.  

- **Prompt:**  
  ``  Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table.``
  
  **Response:**

- **Prompt:**  
  `` Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each.``
  
  **Response:**

#### **3. Preceding Question Prompting**  
A question followed by a deeper explanation or reasoning.  

- **Prompt:**  
  `Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.`  

**Response:**  
Climate change is a global concern because it affects the entire planet, leading to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, food and water insecurity, ecosystem disruption, and economic and health impacts that cross national borders. No country is immune, and global cooperation is essential to mitigate its effects and adapt to its consequences.

- **Prompt:**  
  `How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms.`  

**Response:** 
1. A vaccine is given, usually as a shot. It contains a harmless part of a virus or bacteria (like a protein or a weakened/killed version).
2. Your immune system sees it as a threat and responds by making antibodies—proteins that fight the germ.
3. It also creates memory cells that "remember" how to fight that germ in the future.

#### **4. Missing Word Prompting**  
Fill-in-the-blank style to encourage active recall.  

- **Prompt:**  
  `The capital of France is ____.`
    
  **Response:** **Paris**  

- **Prompt:**  
  `In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____.`
   
  **Response:** **glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.**  

---

### **Conclusion:**  
Using the four prompt types, we explored how to generate diverse responses for the General Knowledge and Science Education . Each method provided a unique way to structure the query, improving clarity and depth of the generated responses.  

---

### **Result:**  
Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, and the report for the chosen use case was generated.
